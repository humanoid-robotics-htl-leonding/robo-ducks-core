== Usage of `MÌ€idas`
The central tool when developing RoboDucks-Code is the midas-script.

``` bash
scripts/midas -h
```

=== Compile and Upload
There are several "targets", each describing a possible device which we can build the code for.

.Targets
. SimRobot " `simrobot` "
. Nao V5 " `nao5` "
. Nao V6 " `nao6` "

There are several "build types", each describing a set of configs and variables set in the
environment.

.Targets
. `debug`: Include debug symbols. Only for use with `gdb` or radare2.
. `develop`: Don't include debug symbols, but include certain Prints and Debug-Code. For use with Mate
. `release`: Fastest. Don't use any debug stuff.

WARNING: If you experience a *very* slow performance (in Mate or even on the field) or tremendous
upload times due to file sizes (e.G 100MB) you are probably compiling for debug. Don't do this if
you don't have to.

NOTE: If you have any questions regarding midas or think that the tool is not documented enough,
please consult Erik Mayrhofer.

== Hulks
We build on top of code from the hulks-team.
