Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
You might need to execute `chmod +x ./Miniconda-#version#` if you don't have permission to run the script.

Execute `conda env create -f environment.yml` in this directory.

# Execution
Run `./start.sh`

## Legacy way (use if other one is not working)

Run Mate with `python run.py`.
